SwissCovid is the official contact tracing app of Switzerland. The app can be installed from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/swisscovid/id1509275381). The app design, UX and implementation was done by [Ubique](https://www.ubique.ch/?app=github).

## Contact tracing

The SwissCovid 2.0 app uses two types of contact tracing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

With proximity tracing close contacts are detected using the bluetooth technology. For this the [DP3T iOS SDK](https://github.com/DP-3T/dp3t-sdk-ios) is used that builds on top of the Google & Apple Exposure Notifications. This feature is called SwissCovid encounters.

With presence tracing people that are at the same venue at the same time are detected. For this the [CrowdNotifier iOS SDK](https://github.com/CrowdNotifier/crowdnotifier-sdk-ios) is used that provides a secure, decentralized, privacy-preserving presence tracing system. This feature is called SwissCovid Check-in.

Please see the [SwissCovid documentation repository](https://github.com/SwissCovid/swisscovid-doc) for more details.
